                               Hi, I am a 28 year old Multimedia designer with a strong passion for digital storytelling, UI- and UX design and visual communication. <br>

                                Since my childhood visual expression and design have been a natural part of my identity. <br>
                                Throughout my Multimedia Design education at UCL have I expanded this passion into professional skills across multible platforms such as Figma, Adobe Lightroom, Photoshoop, After Effects, InDesign and Premiere Pro. <br>

                                    My goals as a designer is to grow inderpendently, build strong digital solutions, and explore new creative directions. <br>
                                    I value storytelling, atmosphere, visual identity and detail oriented design, elements that shape my work across UI, UX, motion graphic and branding. <br>
                                    Hiring me means welcoming a creative, curoius and dedicated designer who thrives in collaborative enviroments and work confidently across multible digital platforms. <br>
